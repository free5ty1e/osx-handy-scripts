# osx-handy-scripts

A collection of handy scripts I've written over the past couple of years as I've been using a Mac as my main development machine.  

I will endeavor to modify any hardcoded items in these scripts to be as modular and generic as possible so they will work in the widest variety of situations.  If anyone else finds these scripts useful, that's great - but this is mainly for my convenience :)

If you check this repo out into your home folder in the default location, you should be able to run the following command to install your scripts:

```
pushd ~/osx-handy-scripts/install && chmod +x installScripts.sh && ./installScripts.sh && popd
```
